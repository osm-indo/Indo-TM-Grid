# Indo-TM-Grid
Welcome to the repository of Perkumpulan OpenStreetMap Indonesia (POI)

This repo aim to provide a collection of Tasking Manager Grids that can be useful to create new task/project in the [Indonesia tasking manager](https://tasks-indonesia.hotosm.org/)

All the grids divided by each province and if you want to create project for lower administration level such as district, sub-district, or village, just use QGIS and perform select by location.

Currently we upload 500m x 500m grids but we aim to upload other size such as 1km x 1km or 1.5km x 1.5km.
